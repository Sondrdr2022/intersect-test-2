`Lane2.py` script, which implements a SUMO RL traffic controller, is running extremely slow on large traffic networks for several reasons:

---

## 1. **Heavy Per-Lane Loops and Data Collection**

- **Code pattern:**  
  In every simulation step, the function `_collect_enhanced_lane_data` iterates over **every single lane** and calls multiple TraCI API functions for each lane:
  ```python
  for lane_id in lanes:
      lane_length = traci.lane.getLength(lane_id)
      queue_length = traci.lane.getLastStepHaltingNumber(lane_id)
      waiting_time = traci.lane.getWaitingTime(lane_id)
      vehicle_count = traci.lane.getLastStepVehicleNumber(lane_id)
      mean_speed = traci.lane.getLastStepMeanSpeed(lane_id)
      edge_id = traci.lane.getEdgeID(lane_id)
      route_id = self._get_route_for_lane(lane_id)
      ambulance_detected = self._detect_priority_vehicles(lane_id)
      ...
  ```
  - **Problem:** For a large network with hundreds or thousands of lanes, this becomes a huge number of TraCI calls, which are **not vectorized** and are **very slow** due to the TCP communication overhead between your script and SUMO.

---

## 2. **Per-Step Lane-Vehicle Route Calculation**

- **Code pattern:**  
  `_get_route_for_lane` and `_detect_priority_vehicles` make further TraCI calls for **every vehicle in every lane**:
  ```python
  vehicles = traci.lane.getLastStepVehicleIDs(lane_id)
  for vid in vehicles:
      ... traci.vehicle.getRouteID(vid) ...
      ... traci.vehicle.getVehicleClass(vid) ...
  ```
  - **Problem:** If there are thousands of vehicles, this results in **tens of thousands of calls per step**.

---

## 3. **Frequent Traffic Light Logic Fetching**

- You often use:
  ```python
  logic = traci.trafficlight.getAllProgramLogics(tl_id)[0]
  ```
  - **Problem:** This call is relatively expensive and you do it often, for every signal, every step, and sometimes repeatedly.

---

## 4. **Extensive Python Data Processing**

- The script maintains many dictionaries and history lists that can grow large, especially if you run long simulations or store per-step or per-lane data (like `self.training_data`, `phase_utilization`, etc.).
- **Problem:** This adds memory and CPU overhead on top of TraCI's own slowness.

---

## 5. **Debug Print Statements in Large Loops**

- In functions like `_process_rl_learning`, you have prints for every lane, every step:
  ```python
  print(f"üèÜ Lane {lane_id} reward components:")
  for comp, value in reward_components.items():
      print(f"  - {comp}: {value:.2f}")
  ```
  - **Problem:** Printing to console is **very slow** in Python when done thousands of times per second.

---

## 6. **Inefficient Adaptive Logic**

- Calculating arrival rates, handling previous states/actions, and updating lane scores are all done per-lane, per-step.
- These can be optimized using vectorized operations or by limiting the frequency of updates.

---

# **How to Improve Speed on Large Networks**

1. **Batch TraCI Calls**  
   Use TraCI's **subscription** mechanism (e.g., `traci.lane.subscribe`) to fetch all attributes for all lanes in one call per step, rather than thousands of calls.

2. **Reduce Per-Step Data Collection**  
   - Only collect the minimal set of metrics you truly need, and reduce the frequency (e.g., every N steps, not every step).
   - Avoid per-vehicle queries for each lane if possible.

3. **Cache Traffic Light Logic**  
   - You already cache some logic, but ensure you use the cache everywhere and avoid re-fetching unless the configuration changes.

4. **Limit Printing**  
   - Only print summary statistics every 100/1000 steps, not per-lane per-step.

5. **Profile the Code**  
   Use Python profilers like `cProfile` to identify the slowest parts of your script and optimize them first.

6. **Reduce Training Data Storage**  
   - Periodically save and clear old entries from `self.training_data` to avoid memory bloat.

7. **Consider Native Extensions**  
   - For very large networks, consider using C/C++ or Cython for the performance-critical parts, or run the logic inside SUMO using its C++ API.

| Printing large amounts of data                 | `print` in loops                                 | Print less, aggregate logs           |
| Traffic light logic fetching                   | `_get_traffic_light_logic`                       | Rely on cache strictly               |
| Large Python data structures growing unbounded | `self.training_data`, reward histories           | Limit history size, save/clear data  |
| Inefficient per-step adaptive logic            | Lane scoring, arrival rates, etc.                | Profile & optimize update frequency  |

**In summary:**  
the controller is slow on large networks because it makes a huge number of individual TraCI API calls, especially per-lane and per-vehicle queries, and prints/logs a lot of data every simulation step. The solution is to use TraCI subscriptions, batch queries, aggressive caching, and limit print/logging to speed up simulation testing.
